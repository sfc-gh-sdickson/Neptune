# Neptune Intelligence Agent - Creation Scripts

This directory contains placeholder scripts related to the creation of the Snowflake Intelligence Agent.

## Important Note

As of the current version of Snowflake, creating and configuring an Intelligence Agent is primarily a **UI-driven process** within the Snowsight interface.

The SQL scripts provided here (`08_create_intelligence_agent.sql` and `08_create_intelligence_agent_no_ml.sql`) serve as placeholders to complete the file structure of the demo but **should not be run directly**.

Please follow the detailed, step-by-step instructions in the `docs/AGENT_SETUP.md` file to correctly create, configure, and test your Neptune Intelligence Agent. That guide provides the correct UI steps and copy-paste content for descriptions and instructions.
